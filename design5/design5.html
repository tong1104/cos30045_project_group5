            <h2><strong> Gendered Lens on Mental Health in the EU</strong></h2>
            <p>
                Depression affects millions across Europe, but the stark gender divide in mental health 
                statistics is both revealing and concerning. Countries like Germany, with one of the highest gender gaps 
                in depressive disorders, highlight how societal roles and expectations may contribute to this divide.
                <br><br> 
                Women, 
                who consistently report higher rates of depression, often face unique stressors such as balancing professional 
                and familial responsibilities, alongside navigating cultural pressures. 
                
            </p>
            <p>
                This data underscores the critical need for gender-specific mental health initiatives. Tailored interventions that 
                address the specific challenges faced by women and men can foster greater inclusivity and effectiveness in treatment.
                <br><br> 
                Acknowledging and understanding these gendered patterns is a vital step toward creating a more empathetic and supportive 
                mental health framework across Europe.
