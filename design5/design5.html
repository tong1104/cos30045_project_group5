            <h2><strong>Gendered Lens on Mental Health in the EU</strong></h2>
            <p>
                Depressive disorders across the European Union show a striking gender gap, with women consistently reporting higher rates of depression than men.
                <br><br> 
                This trend is evident in the data for 2019, 2020, and 2021, where the prevalence of depression among females (represented by the red bars) is consistently higher 
                than that of males (represented by the blue bars) across most countries.
                <br><br>
                Countries like Greece display an especially large gender gap in depression rates, suggesting that societal expectations and gender roles may play a significant role in 
                exacerbating mental health issues for women. 
                <br><br> 
                These findings highlight the need for gender-sensitive mental health interventions that recognize the unique challenges women face, 
                such as balancing family and work life, cultural pressures, and emotional labor, which all contribute to the higher depression rates observed across many EU nations.
                <br><br> 
                Acknowledging and understanding these gendered patterns is a vital step toward creating a more empathetic and supportive 
                mental health framework across Europe.
