            <h2>Understanding Age-Related Trends in Depression Across Europe</h2>
            <p>Depression rates vary widely across Europe, and age appears to be a significant factor influencing these trends. In countries like Greece, which reports the highest overall depression rates (7.30% across all ages), younger populations are particularly affected, reflecting the pressures faced by youth and young adults in todayâ€™s society.</p>
            <p>Interestingly, countries with robust social and healthcare systems, such as Finland and Sweden, also report higher depression rates among younger adults, despite their generally lower overall rates. This may suggest that younger individuals in these countries experience unique social challenges, possibly related to societal expectations or environmental factors like limited sunlight, which is known to impact mental health.</p>
            <p>Overall, the data highlights the importance of age-targeted mental health interventions. Younger age groups, particularly those aged 15-39, seem most vulnerable, pointing to a need for increased mental health support, awareness, and resources for younger generations across Europe.</p>
