                The chart illustrates the relationship between education levels and depression rates across European countries: <br><br>

                <strong>Levels 0-2 (Low Education):</strong> This group consistently shows the highest depression rates. Countries like Germany (13.3%), France (13.4%), and Denmark (14.6%) have notable figures, indicating a strong correlation between lower education levels and increased depression rates. <br><br>

                <strong>Levels 3 and 4 (Medium Education):</strong> Depression rates are generally lower in this group compared to the low education levels. However, countries like Belgium (9%), France (9.9%), and Sweden (10.5%) still show significant rates, suggesting that medium education does not fully alleviate the risk of depression. <br><br>

                <strong>Levels 5-8 (High Education):</strong> High education levels are associated with the lowest depression rates across most countries. Even in countries with generally high rates, such as Sweden (8.4%) and Germany (5.7%), individuals with higher education appear to have better mental health outcomes.
