                The chart illustrates the relationship between education levels and depression rates across European countries: <br><br>

                <strong>Levels 0-2 (Low Education):</strong> This group consistently shows the highest depression rates. Countries like Germany (13.3%), France (13.4%), and Denmark (14.6%) have notable figures, indicating a strong correlation between lower education levels and increased depression rates. <br><br>

                <strong>Levels 3 and 4 (Medium Education):</strong> Depression rates are generally lower in this group compared to the low education levels. However, countries like Belgium (9%), France (9.9%), and Sweden (10.5%) still show significant rates, suggesting that medium education does not fully alleviate the risk of depression. <br><br>

                <strong>Levels 5-8 (High Education):</strong> High education levels are associated with the lowest depression rates across most countries. Even in countries with generally high rates, such as Sweden (8.4%) and Germany (5.7%), individuals with higher education appear to have better mental health outcomes.

                <strong>How Financial Hardship Shadows Mental Well-being in Europe</strong><br><br>
                In Sweden, the impact of income on mental health is clear: depression rates are as high as 18.6% among the lowest-income group, while they drop dramatically to 6.1% among the richest. This stark contrast suggests that financial stability not only relieves daily stress, but also fosters psychological resilience.
                <br><br>
                In Belgium and France, the poorest citizens face higher rates of depression. For many, struggling to make ends meet can have a serious impact on mental health, and each increase in income brings a degree of relief and recovery.
                <br><br>
                However, in Greece and Cyprus, rates of depression are relatively stable across income levels. This suggests that community bonds, cultural values, or support systems may act as a buffer against economic stress.
                <br><br>
                This data is more than just numbers; it is a call for Europe to recognize the link between economic security and mental health. Realized by supporting low-income groups: economic hardship no longer defines mental health.
