                <strong>The Link Between Education and Depression in Europe</strong><br><br>
                To understand the data, it's essential to clarify the three categories used in the visualization:
                <br><br>
                Levels 0-2: Less than Primary, Primary, and Lower Secondary Education
                <br>
                Individuals who have little to no formal education, completed only primary education, or attained lower secondary education.
                <br><br>
                Levels 3-4: Upper Secondary and Post-Secondary Non-Tertiary Education
                <br>
                Individuals who have completed upper secondary education or some form of post-secondary non-tertiary education.
                <br><br>
                Levels 5-8: Tertiary Education
                <br>
                Individuals who have pursued higher education, leading to a university degree or equivalent qualifications (e.g., bachelor’s, master’s, or doctoral degrees).
                <br><br>
                Individuals with lower education (Levels 0-2) show higher rates of depression, as seen in Denmark with rates up to 14.6%. As education attainment increases (Levels 3-4), depression rates tend to decrease. The lowest depression rates are found among those with tertiary education such as in Finland (3.5%).
            </p>            

            <!-- Storytelling for Income Levels -->
            <p id="incomeDesc" class="desc" style="display:none;">
                <strong>How Financial Hardship Shadows Mental Well-being in Europe</strong><br><br>
                In Sweden, the impact of income on mental health is clear: depression rates are as high as 18.6% among the lowest-income group, while they drop dramatically to 6.1% among the richest. This stark contrast suggests that financial stability not only relieves daily stress, but also fosters psychological resilience.
                <br><br>
                In Belgium and France, the poorest citizens face higher rates of depression. For many, struggling to make ends meet can have a serious impact on mental health, and each increase in income brings a degree of relief and recovery.
                <br><br>
                However, in Greece and Cyprus, rates of depression are relatively stable across income levels. This suggests that community bonds, cultural values, or support systems may act as a buffer against economic stress.
                <br><br>
                This data is more than just numbers; it is a call for Europe to recognize the link between economic security and mental health. Realized by supporting low-income groups: economic hardship no longer defines mental health.
            </p>

            <!-- Storytelling for Disability Levels -->
            <p id="disabilityDesc" class="desc" style="display:none;">
                <strong>How Physical Limitations Shape Depression</strong><br><br>
                This analysis explores the association between different levels of physical limitations and the incidence of depression across European countries. To help understand the data, it is first important to clarify the categories used in the visualization:
                <br><br>
                Moderate: This category includes individuals who face some difficulties in daily activities but are still able to manage basic functions independently.
                <br><br>
                Severe: This group represents individuals who have significant physical challenges and often require assistance or adaptations to daily tasks.
                <br><br>
                Some or Severe: This combined category covers moderate and severe limitations.
                <br><br>
                None (no disability): This category includes individuals who report no physical limitations affecting their daily activities, despite depressive symptoms.
                <br><br>
                The deeper the physical limitations, the heavier the mental toll. In countries such as Denmark and Luxembourg, the prevalence of depression among persons with severe disabilities reaches 45.9% and 40.4%.
