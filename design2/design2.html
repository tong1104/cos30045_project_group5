                <strong>The Link Between Education and Depression in Europe</strong><br><br>
                In many European countries, lower levels of education are associated with higher rates of depression. In Croatia and Denmark, depression rates among individuals with low levels of education are as high as 14.1% and 14.6%, respectively, suggesting that they face significant mental health challenges.
                <br><br>
                Depression rates generally decrease with increasing levels of education. Within the secondary education group, countries such as Belgium and Luxembourg still have high rates of depression. Even with secondary education, some populations still face significant mental health challenges, which may be influenced by other socio-economic factors.
                <br><br>
                In the highest education group, the prevalence of depression decreases significantly. In Germany, the depression rate falls to 5.5%, while in Sweden, it drops to 8.4%. This suggests that higher education may have a protective effect against depression, possibly due to better job opportunities, increased income, and access to resources.

            <!-- Storytelling for Income Levels -->
            <p id="incomeDesc" class="desc" style="display:none;">
                <strong>How Financial Hardship Shadows Mental Well-being in Europe</strong><br><br>
                In Sweden, the impact of income on mental health is clear: depression rates are as high as 18.6% among the lowest-income group, while they drop dramatically to 6.1% among the richest. This stark contrast suggests that financial stability not only relieves daily stress, but also fosters psychological resilience.
                <br><br>
                In Belgium and France, the poorest citizens face higher rates of depression. For many, struggling to make ends meet can have a serious impact on mental health, and each increase in income brings a degree of relief and recovery.
                <br><br>
                However, in Greece and Cyprus, rates of depression are relatively stable across income levels. This suggests that community bonds, cultural values, or support systems may act as a buffer against economic stress.
                <br><br>
                This data is more than just numbers; it is a call for Europe to recognize the link between economic security and mental health. Realized by supporting low-income groups: economic hardship no longer defines mental health.

            <!-- Storytelling for Disability Levels -->
            <p id="disabilityDesc" class="desc" style="display:none;">
                <strong>How Physical Limitations Shape Depression</strong><br><br>
                The data reveal a silent truth: the deeper the physical limitations, the heavier the mental toll. In countries such as Denmark and Luxembourg, the prevalence of depression among persons with severe disabilities reaches 45.9% and 40.4%, respectively, revealing a silent struggle that extends beyond the body to the mind.
                <br><br>
                For people with moderate disabilities, the situation has eased, but remains challenging. In Sweden, nearly 18% face depression, showing that even smaller physical burdens can have a serious impact on mental health.
                <br><br>
                In stark contrast, rates of depression are much lower among non-disabled people, such as 2.3% in Austria and 0.8% in Cyprus. This contrast highlights the resilience that physical health can provide, laying the foundation for emotional stability.
