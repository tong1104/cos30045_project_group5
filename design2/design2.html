                <strong>The Link Between Education and Depression in Europe</strong><br><br>
                To understand the data, it's essential to clarify the three categories used in the visualization:
                <br><br>
                Levels 0-2: Less than Primary, Primary, and Lower Secondary Education
                <br>
                Individuals who have little to no formal education, completed only primary education, or attained lower secondary education.
                <br><br>
                Levels 3-4: Upper Secondary and Post-Secondary Non-Tertiary Education
                <br>
                Individuals who have completed upper secondary education or some form of post-secondary non-tertiary education.
                <br><br>
                Levels 5-8: Tertiary Education
                <br>
                Individuals who have pursued higher education, leading to a university degree or equivalent qualifications (e.g., bachelor’s, master’s, or doctoral degrees).
                <br><br>
                Individuals with lower education (Levels 0-2) show higher rates of depression, as seen in Denmark with rates up to 14.6%. As education attainment increases (Levels 3-4), depression rates tend to decrease. The lowest depression rates are found among those with tertiary education such as in Finland (3.5%).

                <strong>How Financial Hardship Shadows Mental Well-being in Europe</strong><br><br>
                To better understand the data, it is essential to clarify the categories used in the visualization:
                <br><br>
                First Quintile (Lowest Income Group): Represents the poorest 20% of the population.
                <br><br>
                Second Quintile (Lower-Middle Income Group): Individuals with slightly better financial stability than the lowest income group but still facing challenges.
                <br><br>
                Third Quintile (Middle Income Group): Reflects the average income earners, who generally have moderate financial stability.
                <br><br>
                Fourth Quintile (Upper-Middle Income Group): Individuals who are financially secure, with fewer concerns about meeting daily needs.
                <br><br>
                Fifth Quintile (Highest Income Group): Represenst the wealthiest 20% of the population.
                <br><br>
                For example, in Sweden, the lowest income group had a higher rate of depression (18.6%), while the highest income group had a lower rate (6.1%).

            <!-- Storytelling for Disability Levels -->
            <p id="disabilityDesc" class="desc" style="display:none;">
                <strong>How Physical Limitations Shape Depression</strong><br><br>
                This analysis explores the association between different levels of physical limitations and the incidence of depression across European countries. To help understand the data, it is first important to clarify the categories used in the visualization:
                <br><br>
                Moderate: This category includes individuals who face some difficulties in daily activities but are still able to manage basic functions independently.
                <br><br>
                Severe: This group represents individuals who have significant physical challenges and often require assistance or adaptations to daily tasks.
                <br><br>
                Some or Severe: This combined category covers moderate and severe limitations.
                <br><br>
                None (no disability): This category includes individuals who report no physical limitations affecting their daily activities, despite depressive symptoms.
                <br><br>
                The deeper the physical limitations, the heavier the mental toll. In countries such as Denmark and Luxembourg, the prevalence of depression among persons with severe disabilities reaches 45.9% and 40.4%.
