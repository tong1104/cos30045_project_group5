            <p><strong>How Europeans View the Importance of Funding for Depression Research</strong></p>
            <p>The data highlights a strong public demand for mental health research funding across Europe, with over 80% of respondents in countries like Ireland and Malta considering it extremely important. This widespread support is reflected across much of Europe, where mental health remains a high priority, as shown by significant backing in Poland and Portugal.</p>
            <p>Collected through survey responses, the data shows the percentage of public opinion for each level of funding importance, calculated for each country. The findings underscore a clear message to policymakers: citizens across Europe see mental health support as essential, calling for immediate government action.</p>
