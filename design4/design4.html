            <p><strong>How Europeans View the Importance of Funding for Depression Research</strong></p>
            <p>The data reveals a powerful message: the vast majority of the population believes that supporting mental health research is not only necessary but crucial. In countries such as Croatia and Cyprus, over 70% of respondents consider funding for depression research to be extremely important, highlighting an urgent public demand for action. This trend is not isolated; across most of Europe, there is a clear priority placed on mental health, with Austria, Belgium, and Finland also showing high support in this category.</p>
            <p>The data paints a clear picture: European citizens are calling for government investment in depression research, with the majority viewing it as critically important. The urgency of these opinions serves as a reminder to policymakers that mental health support is a fundamental aspect of public health that deserves immediate attention.</p>
